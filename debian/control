 sphinxcontrib-trio
 ==================
 .
 This sphinx extension helps you document Python code that uses
 async/await, or abstract methods, or context managers, or generators,
 or ... you get the idea. It works by making sphinx's regular
 directives for documenting Python functions and methods smarter and
 more powerful. The name is because it was originally written for the
 `Trio <https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__ project, and I'm not very
 creative. But don't be put off â€“ there's nothing Trio- or
 async-specific about this extension; any Python project can
 benefit. (Though projects using async/await probably benefit the most,
 since sphinx's built-in tools are especially inadequate in this case.)
